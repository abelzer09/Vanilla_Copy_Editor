## Description
  Welcome to B.V.C.E. the Basic Vanilla Copy Editor. This is the most basict copy (text) editor that you could ever ask for. Install and run locally or off the web your choice. Save all you little jots and notes in one place. Why did I make this because who doesn't want the vanilla latte of text editors. This project was created using Express, JavaScript, webpack, babel, mongodb and delployed via Heroku.
